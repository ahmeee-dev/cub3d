parsing:
    checks:
        the map is even
        the map has only 1 letter [N, S, E, W]
        the map ends with walls in every side
        spaces have to be ignored
    map:
        the first cycle sets che expected length [x]
        y increases as many times as we call the gnl function and is different from NULL
        we allocate an array as long as x * y
space:
    spawn:
        the letter is the direction we are going to face when spawned
        the position of the letter is our position
    prospective:
        the prospective is concentric
    movements:
        x0 and y0 make the top left corner of the map, so x(max) and y(max) convey in the bottom right corner
        every W/S movement means an increase in the xΔ and yΔ
        every A/D turn means an increase or decrease in the a(α) angle.
technique:
    raytracing will be used to create the perspective of the 'character'
